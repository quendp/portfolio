## 📝 Description

This is one of my "experimental" projects where I just want explore the limitations of my creativity under a limited timeframe. I created this (personal website and portfolio) using React JS and Tailwind CSS. I also deployed it using my own domain which I got years ago from Hostinger.

There are also several pages or routes in this website such as the homepage, about, portfolio, curriculum vitae, experience (might change it to blog), and contact page. Meanwhile, all the images I used in this project are also custom-made using Adobo photoshop or illustrator.

Lastly, it took more or less 24 hours to finish v.1.0.0 and I think it was pretty worth it. With that being said, I hope you'll like my work and feel free to give a feedback or suggestion to me either through <a href="mailto:hello@quendp.com"> email </a> or thorugh a pull request.
